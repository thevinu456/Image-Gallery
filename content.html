        <p class="p2">A wildlife corridor, also known as a habitat corridor or green corridor, is an area of habitat
            that connects wildlife populations separated by human activities or structures like roads, development, or
            logging. It allows for the exchange of individuals between populations, which can help prevent the negative
            effects of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity1.</p>

        <p class="p2">Biodiversity describes the richness and variety of life on earth. It is the most complex and
            important feature of our planet. Without biodiversity, life would not sustain.

                <p class="p2">Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including
                    humans. Without a wide range of animals, plants and microorganisms, we cannot have the healthy
                    ecosystems that we rely on to provide us with the air we breathe and the food we eat. And people
                    also value nature of itself.</p>
